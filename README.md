# 3D-Printer-reimagined
Create a 3d Printer from scratch with less moving and mechanical parts that can easily print big volume objects and Design Supporting drivers and software

Yes, It's not a metal bar. It is a 3d printer that can easily print car:

## Why name it "X"
We all studied algebra in school and we call unknown as X, Y, Z etc. Here X can be 3D Printer, or a Mom Assist who can do jobs like dish washing, clearning like how humans sweep the house etc., or an Industrial automation robot.

## Primary challenge

One of the biggest challenge for this project is stepper motor and torque, and my budget limitation for this project.
I feel there should be easy alternative to stepper motor which will delay this project further but can greatly enhance the final product.
I need to make a choice, whether to go ahead with stepper motors available in the market or create something new just for this project that serves the purpose similar to stepper motors. Due to financial constraints, I might delay this project but I am really interested and see numours possiabilities.
